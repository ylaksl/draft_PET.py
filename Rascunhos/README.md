# Pet.py draft Repository

This is a repository dedicated to the drafts of the notebooks made by Ylana Lopes to the PET.py project, where we write Jupyter Notebooks implementing various topics in Python and discuss them.
Until now we have three finished notebooks on Astrophysics and Dynamical Systems applied to Neuroscience, and one on going on disease propagation.
Here are they:

## Astrophysics
- [Gravitacional Microlensing Event Simulation](https://github.com/ylaksl/draft_PET.py/blob/main/Simula%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20de%20Evento%20de%20Microlentes%20Gravitacionai.ipynb)

- [Identifying Planetary Transit](https://github.com/ylaksl/draft_PET.py/blob/main/Identificando%20Tr%C3%A2nsito%20Planet%C3%A1rio.ipynb)

## Dynamical Systems
- [FitzHugh-Nagumo Model: Van der Pol oscilator applied to neural activity](https://github.com/ylaksl/draft_PET.py/blob/main/Modelo%20FitzHugh-Nagumo_O%20oscilador%20de%20Van%20der%20Pol%20em%20disparos%20neurais.ipynb)

- On going: [SIR and SIS: Diasease propagation models visualized](https://github.com/ylaksl/draft_PET.py/blob/main/SIR_SIS_models.ipynb)
